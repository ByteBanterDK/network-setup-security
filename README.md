<h1> <body> Network Infrastructure and Security Setup </body> </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves setting up and securing a home network infrastructure using the ARCHER AX10 router and a Virgin Media box. The goal is to ensure a robust and secure network environment that optimizes connectivity and provides secure access for both primary users and guests. The project includes configuring the router, securing network access, setting up IPv6, and demonstrating how to manage and monitor the network effectively.
<h2>Key Objectives:</h2>
- Set up ARCHER AX10 Router: Establishing the ARCHER AX10 router and configuring it with the Virgin Media box for optimal performance.
- Secure Network Access: Configuring secure passwords and enabling WPA3 encryption to ensure network security.
- Guest Network Configuration: Setting up a separate guest network to provide secure and limited access for visitors.
- IPv6 Configuration: Enabling and configuring IPv6 to future-proof the network and improve performance.
- Router Management: Demonstrating how to use the router's web interface for configuration and monitoring.
- QR Code Generation: Creating QR codes for easy Wi-Fi access, allowing guests to connect to the guest network by scanning the code with their phones.
- Network Monitoring: Using built-in router tools to monitor network performance and connected devices.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
Languages: Bash, Command Prompt (CMD)
Utilities: OBS Studio (for recording setup process), QR Code generators

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
Operating Systems: Windows 10 Pro, Android/iOS (for smartphone setup)
Hardware: ARCHER AX10 Router, Virgin Media Box
Tools: Router's web interface, QR Code generation tools

<h2>Program Walk-through:</h2>
<br />
Let's start off by setting up the ARCHER AX10 Router on the computer first. Procced to connect your ethernet cable router to your ISP.
